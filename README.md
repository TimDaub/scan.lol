> A website to quickly scan a qr code without installing an app

- [app](https://scan.lol)

## Motivation

Don't you hate it that when you have to quickly scan a QR (QUICK RESPONSE) code but first you have to:

- Install a stupid app from the app store
- Wait for it to download and install
- Click away 1000 ads
- App crashes
- Reopen app
- Scan QR code

Yeah, me too. Hence, I made this website called scan.lol that is quickly to type in any mobile phone browser.
